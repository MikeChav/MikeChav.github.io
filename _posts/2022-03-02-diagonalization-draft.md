title: (DRAFT) A multitool

Perhaps a common tool for many, *diagonalization* is one those seemingly simple techniques that has blown my mind
over and over. Like most people, my first encounter with it was with Cantor's proof that $$\|\mathbb{N}\| < \|\mathbb{R}\|$$.
I must admit, the beauty of the technique was lost onto me the first time I saw, it seemed too simple to matter, just like
the Pigeon Hole Principle or the triangle inequalities (I know, how dare I). After spending some time studying complexity 
theory and how diagonalization has been used to prove some **very** interesting theorems, I now can admit how wrong I was.
The intention of this post is for me to pay tribute to the wonderful technique with which Georg Cantor has gifted us.

introduce diagonalization

historical

early application in computability

uses in complexity

where to go after with similar techniques
