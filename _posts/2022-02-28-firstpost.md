# Welcome!

This first post is sort of my way of setting up the foundations of my 
expectations for this blog. It's a new project that isn't quite settled yet,
but I hope, can help me in several ways:

1. Share my learning journey in complexity theory.
2. Organize my thoughts (and progress) into a way that keeps me accountable.
3. Improve my writing abilities my forcing me to practice.

Your thought now is probably the following: "Why should _I_ read this blog
when there are already several excellent ones out there?" and I don't have a 
good answer yet (I'm not trying to sell a product). I just hope to have interesting 
enough things to say.

Topics that I hope to cover include topics that I find particularly interesting,
short intro/tutorials on certain topics (which I might include in my teaching practice),
updates on my work, and some thoughts on what I observe as I become immersed in the field.

With that being said, do keep an eye out for my first *actual* post sometime soon! Feedback is
certainly more than welcome :) .
